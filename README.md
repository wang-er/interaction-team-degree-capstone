# Centiv

**Live Demo: https://centiv.netlify.app/**

Centiv is a motivational and goal documenting app that lets users wager their money as a motivator to accomplish their goal. After documenting enough days, whether it’s taking a photo or writing an entry, they’ll receive their money back and treat themselves to a reward. Think of this app like a piggy bank – you can put in money, but it’s hard to get it back. After some time or achievement, you can break the piggy bank and get your money back for a treat!

## Motivator
People have reacted differently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By being stuck at home, some people started to pick up old hobbies or start news ones as a means to cope. Others are stuck feeling demotivated, wanting to pick up activities but don’t have the push they need to start.

We wanted a way to encourage people to start or continue these hobbies to create positive moments in a time of uncertainty and stress. How could we motivate people during a prolonged time of stress? Therefore, we created Centiv – an app that gives that initial push for users to continue their goals. 

## Key Audiences
While our primary target audience was college students and people who primarily use their phone for social media, this app is appropriate for the general public.
